### *How we did it*

Our project is about streaming music video.
After analizing the project requirements and deadlines, we decided to make a list of all the functionalities.
In order to have a good overview and to manage all these functionalities, we were agree that using Trello is the best choice.

***Methodology:*** After breaking the work into goals that can be completed in one or two days, we tracked progress and re-plan the project having daily meetings every morning.

- First, we created a database schema, in order to have a detailed overview over the data needed in the project.

- While coding, we tried to add comments in order that everybody understands the meaning of that code 

### Mockup used 
For the main page, we've used [this mokeup](http://demo.dawnthemes.com/viem/).  
For the video pages, we've used a selfmade (and beautifull) design:

The rest of the pages followed the same design as the first two pages.
